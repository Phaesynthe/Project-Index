## Basic Features ##
### Map ###
- 2d representation of a galaxy with stars and other navigable locations as points
- 2d representation of a star system with variable zooming level
- 2d representation of the vicinity of normal space (planet local and encounters).
- 2d representation of the surface of land-able bodies broken into  sectors

### Navigation ###
- To change systems, open galaxy map and you will see two circles around your current location. One represents you current maximum jump range, while the other larger represents your current maximum range based on current fuel levels and engine consumption. Click on a star and instruct the helm to jump to the star. Jump Drive
- To change location in a system, tap on a location and instruct the helm to navigate there. The ship will then move in a straight line from the current location to the indicated location based on the vessel's current FTL capabilities.
- If the destination is an encounter-able, then the vicinity will be opened. Navigation here works the same as system navigation, but does not use FT, but uses standard newtonian propulsion instead.
- Going into orbit of a planet opens the planetoid map of sectors. From here, you can scan the planet, dispatch landing parties, deploy structures, and manage any planet-side colonies and bases (note: management of these can be done remotely with the right tech)
