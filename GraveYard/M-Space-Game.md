# Matthew’s Space Game #

## Must haves ##
- Ship boarding
- Hitchhiking device - flavor text calls out Douglas Adams
  - Pops you onto a random nearby ship, random location, guaranteed semi-safe
  - Weaknesses - too many hitchhiking devices interfere with each other
  - Hitchhiking requires acceptance, though a hacked device could skip that
  - Complete crafting - everything that exists in the game can be crafted or gathered, with few exceptions
- No major galactic powers
- Travel from place to place is - in system FTL and standard propulsion, and out of system teleport
- Deployable turrets and shields generators, and drones
- Near infinite number of systems
- Many playable races
  - Each with their own environmental requirements
  - Easy to get suits for most races to exist in ‘standard’ environment used in stations.
- You do not know the value or values of a system or space body until you have surveyed it
- Surveying takes time and specialized equipment
- System survey, planet, mineralogy, climatology, biology, ext.
- Autopilot is a must
- Advanced navigation modules (pre programmed flight patterns)
- Module level power and configuration. Allows overloading and under loading
- Crew
- Alot of crew and options
- Ships sizes ranging from tiny to near planet sized
- Jumping into a system places the ship in the outer most points of the system.
- Space ports exis tin on the fringes (in safe space) of systems and serve a a safe place for large ships to dock and load or offload as needed
- Most system traffic is smaller ships that operate under traffic control
- For every action, there should be a counter action
- Counter actions are not just easy
- Technology above standard is fully developed by players (auto labs and staff)
- All constructed things are build by choosing a chassis of sort and then placing modules in it. This allows any action that can be done to be done anywhere with enough research and creativity (cloaked interdiction missiles … self replicating sticky leach mines)
- Players can just wander, manage their ship’s crew, wing ships, stations, colonies, and entire systems.
- Players can ‘body hop’ into a surrogate any distance away to play as they wish. They are acting as themselves.
- Physical things cannot travel with the player
- The argument for this mechanic is that, with travel between systems being instant regardless of distance, adding such a feature doesn’t add serious abuse points to the game where it does add a way that players can more easily interact with one another.
- Ship operations generally require more than one person. The more complicated (number of modules) the more people are required to maintain or configure them. As well as more people requiring more services.
- All module performance characteristics can be tweeked.
- A very wide variety of ships (looking for hundreds if not more).
