# Zombie Survival #
The game initializes by either generating a city or loading a pre-made map. It then generates a random appropriate population for the city. The player is inserted into the game as a citizen an amount of time prior to the incident.
 
The game plays by running the simulation as services are stopped, supplies begin to diminish, and each citizen tries to survive. Survival is made more difficult by needing to fight off or avoid the infected, which in turn makes the living more dangerous.
